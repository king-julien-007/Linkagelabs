LinkageLab is a lightweight mechanism simulation environment developed in Python and Tkinter, supported by a complementary TypeScript-based web framework for future browser deployment. The application enables users to construct planar linkages by placing joints, connecting links, and applying geometric or motor constraints while maintaining real-time physical consistency. It integrates features such as snapping, constraint solving, FABRIK-based inverse kinematics, coupler path tracing, JSON-based project saving, and PostScript export for documentation. LinkageLab includes a configurable 4-bar generator with adjustable parameters and optional Grashof enforcement, providing an efficient workflow for both academic and engineering use. Built with a clean modular design, the project serves as a practical tool for mechanism study and a foundation for extending linkage analysis into modern web environments.
